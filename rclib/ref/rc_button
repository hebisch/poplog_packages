        width, height,
        action_spec,
        style,
        specs) -> button

USES
    rclib, rc_buttons (rc_window_object)

EXAMPLE

    define btn_action(); [ouch]=> enddefine;
    vars btn = create_rc_button(-100, 80, false, false,
                            ['My button' ^btn_action], "action", false);

Argument list

    x, y
        Coordinates of top-left corner of button, in the current
        rc_window_object (see REF * rc_new_window_object).

        Place words may be used (e.g. "right", "top"), see REF * placement.

    width, height
        Width and height of the button. Either or both may be false,
        to use default values.

    action_spec
        A two element list [label action].

        label
            A string, or word, or number.

        action

            One of the following:

            A string, which is interpreted as a VED ENTER command.

            A word (the name of a procedure to be run), an ident whose
            idval is a procedure, or a procedure itself. The procedure
            is run when the user clicks on the button, and is called
            without arguments.

            A list, the first element is special word (see below) or a
            procedure or the name of a procedure, the remaining elements
            are arguments to the procedure. NB the arguments are not
            evaluated at action time, but are passed directly to the
            action procedure.

            A vector of one element, which is a string. The string is
            evaluated as pop11 code.

        In the case that the action is a list, certain special strings may
        occur as the first item in the list. The rest of the list ought to
        be treated as an action, but the documentation lists a whole lot of
        ad-hoc alternatives. In particular if the list is three or more
        elements (including the special word) it is treated as pop11 code.
        If it is only two elements and the second is a word or procedure,
        that procedure is the action.

            POPNOW -- this cause the button click to be processed
            immediately, rather than waiting until poplog has processed
            other stuff.

            POP11 -- the rest of the list is pop11 code. Is this true in
            general, I wonder? Or is it just a special case of three or
            more elements?

            Other stuff -- exists, but is not documented yet.

    vector_action_spec
        A three or four element vector {type label arg} or
        {type label arg spec}.

        The label component is the same as label in an action_spec (see
        above).

        Possible values for type are:

            "action", "blob", "counter", "toggle", "invisible"

        in addition the values

            "option", "radio", "select"

        are used internally by other rclib functions.

        When the type is "action", the arg is the same as an action in
        an action_spec (see above).

        When the type is "toggle", the arg is the name of a boolean
        variable, whose value is toggled between true and false by
        successive clicks on the button.

        The other types are not documented yet.

        The spec component of a four element vector is an alternative
        to the specs argument to create_rc_button. Whether it overrides
        it or is additional (and which takes priority) is a mystery, but
        I guess it overrides it (i.e. spec is interpreted after specs).

    style
        Either the word "action", the word "blob" or the word "invisible".

        May be false in the case that the vector_action_spec form of
        the function is used.

        The choice affects the way the button is drawn.

    ignored
        This argument must be present but is ignored. A safe value to use
        in this case is false.

    specs
        A featurespec or false -- see HELP * FEATURESPEC.
